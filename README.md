# Java
My first android project, a simple coffee ordering app.
The name plays on the word, as the Java Island of Indonesia is famous for its coffee, and JAVA as a language is used in android development.
The app takes an order and gives 2 options to either pay on arrival or pay online.
If the pay online option is choosen it takes us to paytm.com for payment.
And if pay on arrival is choosen then the timer starts in our mobile for order collection.
